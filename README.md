# Anti-Poachers (Working Title)

    Winter Game Jam Idea:
        - Gen 4 style because I hate myself. (fuck it, Kyledove time)
        - I still want battles. No exceptions (maybe exceptions)
        - Poachers... do something, and the player is gonna stop them and save the pokeymans, yay!
    
        Plot:
            - Poachers have been capturing the rare mons in the remote area, and the player, a local ranger, is the only one close enough to stop them before they make off with the pokemon.
                - Their effects are more reaching than just the removal of said pokemon, as related mons (older evolutions) have become more aggressive against strangers to chase them away and protect their young.
            - Has to be in an area where backup is not available in a timely basis.
                - Snowstorm time!
            - Poachers get frozen to death (with exception to one who points out the fatally wounded Gmax Lapras)
            - The game requires going up and down the mountain to collect the leaves to make the salve for the Lapras
                - Secondary object is freeing/rescuing the 'uncollected' captured mons from traps.
                - The only required one is Camerupt, for its warm body, allowing you to approch the raging Lapras.
